# OpenCL Raytracing

![](/screenshots/screenshot3.jpg)

## IDEAS

1. Add cuboids
2. New materials: metal, fog, jelly (diffuse + dielectric)
3. Spatial partitioning and other optimisation (random number generation, mesh-ray intersection)

## DONE

Load textures while loading models (instead of manual loading)
Handle null cases in the scene creation
Create a scene from file
Fix random sampling (no more bands)
